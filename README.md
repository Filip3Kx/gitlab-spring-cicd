# gitlab-spring-cicd

This is a take take to implement CI/CD into an Eventuate template but change all of the tools. Here is the CI/CD pipeline that will build and test the code to then push it into a kubernetes cluster using Docker containers. 

I've tested the solution on Google Cloud Platform using dedicated Kubernetes Service and a Docker version of GitLab.
